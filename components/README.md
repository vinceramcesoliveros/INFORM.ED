# COMPONENTS

> These folders are strucutred based on the root folder of the project.
The reason for this is it can get confusing to navigate Components inside of a folder.
So to make sure they're organized, I will be basing it on the root folder of the
project.


## Layout Componente
This Folder holds all the layouting and have its own separation for one purpose only.
It is shown mostly on the dashboard, login, or error page.

## Loign Component
This holds the component under the `pages/login.vue` file. To make use of Asynchronous
components as a feature from vuejs to load individual components for better user
experience.

## Account Component.
**TBD**
The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.
