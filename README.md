# INFORM.ED

Open source project that can be used in any colleges/universities/institutions, Using NuxtJS to power up the tools
and simplify the workflow. The Goal of the Project is to decentralize the education system we are facing today.

<hr>

## Sub Projects

- Superpowered Enrollment System with payment integration(SOON)
- Decentralized Club Organization Platform(SOON)
- SMS & Email Updates to all sub-projects(SOON)

### Problem:

We want our status of education to be digitalized, not stored in a university, and not stored in a tangible documents. There can be a sub-project prior to this big project. Which will be included in the future release.
